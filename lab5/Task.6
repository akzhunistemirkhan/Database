3 design goals are:
1. lossless-join decompositions, 
2. dependency preserving decompositions, 
3. and minimization of repetition of information.
They are desirable so we can maintain an accurate database, 
check correctness of updates quickly, 
and use the smallest amount of space possible.
Lossless join and dependency preserving are the two goals of the decomposition.
Undesirable Properties of Bad Design Redundancy, 
resulting in waste of space and complicated updates (inconsistencies.) 
Inability to represent certain information – ex Null values. 
Loss of information.
